[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought, "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
